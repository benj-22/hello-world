## A Little About Me
Here is an ordered list of things about me:
1. I like to eat **ice cream**
2. I like my dog *a lot*
3. I like to play Kingdom Hearts ![alt text](rox.jpg)
4. I have two hands
Anyway, here is a quote from Sherlock Holmes I read recently:
> “Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to use all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment.”
> **Okay let's see how it turned out**
